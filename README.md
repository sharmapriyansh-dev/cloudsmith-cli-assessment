# Cloudsmith CLI Assessment

This repository contains the complete documentation and evidence of my Cloudsmith CLI assignment, demonstrating the management of repositories, packages, and account configurations using the Cloudsmith CLI tool.

Included in this repo are:

- Step-by-step markdown documentation for each task of the assessment
- Screenshots capturing terminal outputs and command executions
- Structured directories separating docs and assets for clarity

This project highlights practical usage of Cloudsmith CLI in real-world scenarios, such as repository creation, package management, token generation, and account policy setup. The repository is also configured to publish via GitHub Pages for easy review and presentation.

Feel free to explore the site for detailed guides and results.
