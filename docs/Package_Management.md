# Task 3: Package Management

This page details how I used the Cloudsmith CLI for package operations in my organizationâ€™s repositories. All terminal outputs are evidenced by corresponding screenshots.

## 1. Upload a Package

I created a simple package (`example_package_psharma-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl`) for upload. To upload it to the repository created in Task 2:

> cloudsmith push python psharma-dev/cloudsmith-cli-psharma-dev example_package_psharma-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
